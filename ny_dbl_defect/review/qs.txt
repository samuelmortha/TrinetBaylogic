Sam,  

I noticed that you logged 160 hours so far for this story and I also inquired about this a month ago. 
Was this something identified as a complex one since there are no story points? 
I would like to understand why this is taking longer (1 month Dev time) to fix â€“ 
Is this a requirement clarification or taking longer to troubleshoot since the root cause is already specified as SQL filter excluded remote locations.
 
 
Bill, I recall this query was provided by George Corona last quarter originally which went through UAT and QE as well. 
 
Shyla, please note this item for next retrospective meeting as well. 
 
Regards,
Sumanth

Hi Sumanth,

I am logging the total hours spent in the day, this includes hours worked on the story, scrum call, retrospective, sprint planning, research done and VDI issues.

Also the issue is a bit complex to me as I am new to the PeopleSoft schema.

And the root cause is specified after debugging into the issue.

Right now, the sql and Java code are updated and being reviewed.


Thank you,
Sam.




























Q1 : I was informed that Subquery needs to have the filters of outer query ? 
Updated by me :
select distinct l.location, l.descr, l.address1, l.address2, l.city, l.state, l.postal 
from p.ps_location_tbl l
where l.state = 'NY'
	and l.setid = 'USPEO'
	and l.eff_status = 'A'
	and l.effdt = (select max(l1.effdt) from p.ps_location_tbl l1
					where l.setid = l1.setid
						and l.location = l1.location
						and l.state = l1.state
						and l.eff_status = l1.eff_status
						and l1.effdt <= p_effective_date);
						
select 
	j.company,
	j.location, 
	count(+1) as total_employees, 
	count(case when pde.sex = 'M' or pde.sex = 'U' then +1 end) as dbl_males, 
	count(case when pde.sex = 'F' then +1 end) as dbl_females,
	sum(j.annual_rt) as covered_annual_payroll
from ny_dbl_work_locations_data_temp a , p.ps_job j ,p.ps_pers_data_effdt pde
where a.location = j.location
  and j.emplid = pde.emplid
  and j.empl_status in ('A','L','P','S')  -- actives only, no terms
  and j.paygroup <> 'NP' -- trusted advisor
  and j.company <> '31T'  -- this is a test company
  and j.emplid not like 'C%'  -- this omits cobra employees
  and (j.empl_class not in ('K1','K1E','K1D') or j.empl_class is null) -- omit K1 employees -- RALCAF-3201
  and pde.effdt = (select max(pde1.effdt) from p.ps_pers_data_effdt pde1
                    where pde.emplid       = pde1.emplid
                      and pde1.effdt      <= p_effective_date)
  and j.effdt = (select max(j1.effdt) from p.ps_job j1
                where j.emplid       = j1.emplid
                  and j.empl_rcd     = j1.empl_rcd
                  and j.company      = j1.company
                  and j.location     = j1.location
                  and j.empl_status  = j1.empl_status
                  and j.paygroup     = j1.paygroup
                  and j.empl_class 	 = j1.empl_class
                  and j1.effdt      <= p_effective_date)
 and j.effseq = (select max(j2.effseq) from p.ps_job j2
                  where j.emplid      = j2.emplid
                    and j.empl_rcd    = j2.empl_rcd
                  	and j.company     = j2.company
                  	and j.location    = j2.location

                  	and j.paygroup    = j2.paygroup
                  	and j.empl_class  = j2.empl_class
                    and j2.effdt      = j.effdt)
group by rollup(j.company,j.location);
						
-					and j.company      = j1.company
-                  and j.location     = j1.location
-                  and j.empl_status  = j1.empl_status
-                  and j.paygroup     = j1.paygroup


						
Q2 : p_effective_date is usually the date that we generate the file, we still did not include the policy start date in the query.

A) does 
case when (g.t2_comp_term_dt > p_effective_date) then 'CANCEL'
mean the future cancellation 

case when (g.t2_comp_term_dt > p_effective_date) then 'Client''s Request'
